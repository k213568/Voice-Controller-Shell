# How Our Conversation Goes

- system asks "say Something"
- we say The Command
- system Runs The Commands if Valid

We have created a shell that can interact with the user through voice commands and provide output from the terminal.
The overall shell is based on voice inputs meaning user can call shell commands without inputting physically with the system.
The commands are very user friendly and commonly used over the world through communication.
Working:
1)	When the shell is executed it ask to say a voice command from the above mentioned commands.
2)	Once the user says the command a system call is generated with the help of subprocess module ordering the original terminal to execute the command by converting the user said command to the original shell command.
3)	Once the system call gets it results from the kernal, it returns with a utf-8 encoded output
4)	By decoding the output, the result of the command is viewed in front of the user’s screen as a program output

Following commands are embedded in the program that can stimulate the shell and provide response 

List Files:
as user said list files a system call is generated with ‘ls’ in argument and provide the output from the terminal.

who created you :shows you the creator(s) of the program.

Note: if something is not mentioned means that it gives you output as a voice output so I was unable to demonstrate the audio through pictures, however you can execute the program to be able to witness the best work and results.

Conclusion:
These commands are flexible meaning it is gathered with multiple possibilities of command a user can say if it matches even a little to the embedded command, it provides the results.
